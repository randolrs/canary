		<h2>Why Use Artagmi?</h2>

		<p>Artagami provides an additional layer of engagement for art collectors .  Artist cannot always be present at their exhibitions.  Furthermore, if their exhibition is in a venue such as a cafe, restaurant, or ... the staff are usually not trained to sell art and probably don't know much about the artwork or the artist.  Artagmi bridges this gap by providing art collectors fast access to additional information about the artwork and the artist, in the artists own words. Seamless integration with commerce as well purchase it if they like what they see.</p>
