		<h3>What does ArtYam do?</h3>

		<p>ArtYam helps artists sell more art in non-gallery venues like cafes, retail shops, restaurants, banks, hospitals, etc.</p>

		<p>ArtYam puts artists in control of their marketing in any venue by giving them the tools to directly engage art collectors with information about themselves and their artwork through online tear sheets.  ArtYam also provides payment processing capabilities that enable art collectors to buy artwork on-the-spot, commission-free!</p>

		<h3>Why do you need ArtYam?</h3>

		<p>You need ArtYam because it overcomes the 3 biggest obstacles to selling more art in non-gallery venues:</p>

		<br>

		<ol class="landing-page-list">
			
			<li><span class="red-text">Challenge #1:</span> Venue staff often lack the incentive and/or knowledge to sell your art</li>

			<p>For most non-gallery venues, selling art is not their primary business; therefore, the venue staff have very little incentive to sell your work or even know anything about it.  This means you are missing opportunities to convert an art collector from "interested" to "buying" because they cannot get more information about you or your work.</p>

			<p><span class="green-text paragraph-intro">Solution:</span> ArtYam creates online tear sheets that provide art collectors with instant access to additional information about you and your work. These tear sheets provide information that simply cannot fit on printed display labels or business cards.</p>

			<br>

			<li><span class="red-text">Challenge #2:</span> It's difficult to engage potential buyers after they leave the venue</li>

			<p>Traditional advice on engaging collectors after they leave a venue where an artist's work is displayed is to provide something for the collector to take with them, such as a business card or printed promotional material.  However, these printed materials  have limited effectiveness because they have a tendency to get misplaced, either by the venue or the potential buyer.</p>

			<p><span class="green-text paragraph-intro">Solution:</span> ArtYam gives art collectors the ability to email to themselves a detailed tear sheet for your work in order to review later. Additionally, ArtYam sends follow-up emails to determine if a collector is still interested in buying your piece.</p>

			<br>

			<li><span class="red-text">Challenge #3:</span> No instant purchasing options</li>

			<p>Artists frequently lose sales between the time an art collector contacts them through traditional channels (like email) and when the artist redirects them to a third party payment processor, like Paypal or SquareUp. Collectors may lose interest or simply forget to complete the transaction.</p>  

			<p><span class="green-text paragraph-intro">Solution:</span> ArtYam gives collectors the option to buy your work on-the-spot with any major credit card through the artwork's easily accessible online tear sheet.</p>

		<h3>How does ArtYam work?</h3>

		<br>

		<ol class="landing-page-list">
			
			<li>Create ArtYam tear sheets for your artwork.</li>

			<p>Simply upload a photo of your work along with a few basic details, such as the title and a description, and ArtYam generates an online tear sheet for the artwork where collectors can learn more about the artwork and you.  Online tear sheets also give art collectors the option to buy your work on-the-spot. Setting up an ArtYam tear sheet takes about three minutes.</p>

			<%= link_to direct_link_to_item_art_path("62b1") do %>
			
				<div>
					<img class="home-page-sample-artwork" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/canaryair/home-page-sample-artwork-page.jpg"></img>
					<p class="centered"><%= link_to "ArtYam.com/62b1", direct_link_to_item_art_path("62b1") %> </p>
				</div>

			<%end%>

			<br>


			<li>ArtYam provides a short, readable links to your tear sheets that you include in the printed label below your display.</li>

			<p>ArtYam generates links (i.e. <%= link_to "ArtYam.com/62b1", direct_link_to_item_art_path("62b1") %>) that are easy to include in the printed label for your display.  This makes the ArtYam tear sheet for the piece instantly accessible on any device to anyone that sees your display.</p>

			<br>

			<li>ArtYam tear sheets engage art collectors.</li>

			<p> In addition to providing additional information about you and your artwork, ArtYam tear sheets give art collectors the ability to email the tear sheet to themselves to review later and purchase the art online using any major credit card. ArtYam forwards all relevant buyer contact information to you and remits proceeds from your sales to you within 2 business days.</p>
