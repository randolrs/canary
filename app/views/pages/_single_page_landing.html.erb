		<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>

		<p><b>1. Create a Page for Your Artwork</b> | Upload a photo of your artwork and provide a few basic details that art collectors want to know (dimensions, description of the piece, etc.). ArtYam automatically generates a short, shareable link to this information that can be included in art displays (such as <%= link_to "ArtYam.com/" + ItemArt.last.search_code, direct_link_to_item_art_path(ItemArt.last.search_code) %>)</p>

		<p><b>2. Share your ArtYam Links in your Art Displays</b> | Using your short, readable ArtYam links, art collectors can access additional information about your artwork on any mobile device and buy your artwork in less than 3 minutes.</p>

		<p><b>3. We Sell Your Art anf Pay You</b> | We process payments online from any major credit cards on your behalf and remit payment to you via direct deposit.</p>

		<h2>Why Use ArtYam?</h2>

No other company provides solutions these specifically tailored for artists.</p>
