		<h3>You're missing opportunites to engage people who love your artwork.</h3>

		<p>ArtYam was designed to serve artists that sell their art in public venues like cafes, bars, and restaurants.  We understand the challenge of selling your art in a venue whose primary business is not art, where the venue's staff does not know much about you or your artwork.</p>

		<p>ArtYam addresses that challenge by giving every person that sees your artwork direct access to additional information about you and your artwork as well as the ability to purchase your artwork online instantly or in the future.</p>
