		<h3>Why do artists need ArtYam?</h3>

		<p>Artists need ArtYam because it overcomes the 3 biggest obstacles to selling more art in non-gallery venues:</p>

		<br>

		<ol class="landing-page-list">
			
			<li>Lack of staff incentive and knowledge</li>

			<p>For most non-gallery venues, selling art is not their primary business; therefore, the venue staff very little incentive to sell an artist's work or even know anything about it.  This means many missed opportunities to convert a potential buyer from "interested" to "buying".</p>

			<p>ArtYam solves this problem by creating online tear sheets  that provide potential buyers with instant access to additional information about artists and their work as well as online purchasing options.</p>

			<br>

			<li>Lack of ability to engage potential buyers after they leave the venue</li>

			<p>Traditional advice on engaging collectors after they leave a venue where an artist's work is displayed is to provide something for the collector to take with them, such as a business card or printed promotional material.  However, most artists know these printed materials are ineffective because they have a tendency to get misplaced, either by the venue or the potential buyer.</p>

			<p>ArtYam solves this problem by giving art collectors the ability to email a detailed tear sheet for an artist's work to themselves to review later. Additionally, the ability to capture collectors' emails means artists can followup with them in the future about new shows, etc.</p>

			<br>

			<li>No instant purchasing options</li>

			<p> Artists frequently lose sales between the time an art collector contacts them through traditional channels (like email) and when the artist redirects them to a third party payment processor like Paypal or SquareUp. Collectors may lose interest or simply forget to complete the transaction.</p>  

			<p>ArtYam solves this problem by giving collectors the ability to instantly buy an artist's work online with any major credit card.</p>

		<h3>How does ArtYam work?</h3>

		<p><b>1. Artists create ArtYam tear sheets for their artwork.</b> Artists upload a photo of their work to ArtYam along with a few basic details, such as the title and a description.  ArtYam then generates an online tear sheet for the artwork where collectors can learn more about the artwork and the artist, as well as buy the piece online. Setting up an ArtYam tear sheet takes about three minutes.</p>

		<%= link_to direct_link_to_item_art_path("62b1") do %>
			
			<div>
				<img class="home-page-sample-artwork" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/canaryair/home-page-sample-artwork-page.jpg"></img>
				<p class="centered"><%= link_to "ArtYam.com/62b1", direct_link_to_item_art_path("62b1") %> </p>
			</div>

		<%end%>

		<p><b>2.ArtYam provides a short link to the artist's tear sheet that is easy to include in displays.</b> Artists include their ArtYam links (i.e. <%= link_to "ArtYam.com/62b1", direct_link_to_item_art_path("62b1") %>) in the placard for their display, typically below the title, dimensions, and price.  This makes the ArtYam tear sheet for the piece instantly accessible to anyone that sees the piece.</p>

		<p><b>3. ArtYam tear sheets engage art collectors.</b> In addition to providing additional information about the artwork and the artist, ArtYam tear sheets give art collectors the ability to email the tear sheet to themselves to review later and purchase the art instantly using any major credit card. ArtYam forwards all relevant buyer contact information to the artist and remits proceeds from sales to the artist within 2 business days.</p>
